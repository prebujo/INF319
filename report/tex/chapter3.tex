\chapter{Solution Method}
Describe Local search algorithms and refer some papers. 
These algorithms can have difficulties moving from one solution space to another, even when this is cosidered in the metaheuristics. \par
A way to deal with this could be to, refer to some paper that tries to implement some form of heuristic to search larger neighbourhoods.
