\chapter{Solution Methods}
\label{ch:methods}

Describe Local search algorithms and refer some papers. 
These algorithms can have difficulties moving from one solution space to another, even when this is cosidered in the metaheuristics. \par
A way to deal with this could be to, refer to some paper that tries to implement some form of heuristic to search larger neighbourhoods.


\section{Diversification}
\label{sec:divers}
Describe different heuristic approaches to diversification. Simmulated annealing acceptance criteria, memory of tabu, large neighbourhood search alns.

\section{Intensification}
\label{sec:intens}
describe different heuristical approaches to intensification. LNS searches locally.. read up to find other intensification heuristics..
