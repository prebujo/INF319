\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.1}{\ignorespaces Example of a solution representation of a problem with 5 orders and 3 vehicles. A vehicle schedule, represented by $S_v$, contain information for each vehicle $v$, on which and in what order a vehicle schould pick up and deliver orders. The dark green tiles represent a pickup, the red tiles represent a delivery. The $0$ tiles separate each vehicle schedule. The complete permutaion represent our solution representation $s$.\relax }}{19}{figure.caption.6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.2}{\ignorespaces A swap heuristic performed on a vehicle schedule with three orders.
